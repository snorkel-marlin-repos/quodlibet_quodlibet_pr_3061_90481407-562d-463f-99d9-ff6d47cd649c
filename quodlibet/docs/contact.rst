Contact
=======

It's easy to find the email addresses of Quod Libet's authors and 
maintainers, but please don't email us directly unless asked to, or if it 
concerns us specifically. If you contact just us, it means no one else can 
help you, and we can be really bad about replying to email.

If you have a question or want to report a bug please `open a new issue
<https://github.com/quodlibet/quodlibet/issues/new>`_ on the GitHub issue
tracker.

If you want to address the wider Quod Libet community consider sending a mail
to our `quod-libet-devel Google group
<http://groups.google.com/group/quod-libet-development>`_.

Quod Libet has an IRC channel on `OFTC <https://www.oftc.net/>`_ ,
*#quodlibet*. It is a good place to ask for help with installation and
configuration, or discuss development (assuming people there are paying
attention).
